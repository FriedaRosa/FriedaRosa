## Hi there 👋 I'm Frieda

I'm a researcher with a bachelor's and master's degree in biology - both with strong focus on plants, macroecology and macroevolution. I'm working at the intersection of macroecology, macroevolution, and biogeography. 
I use mostly computational methods to explore ecological and evolutionary patterns — from simulating species distributions to modeling phylogenetic signals, reconstructing species characteristics back to 100 million years ago, and biodiversity change over time.


### 🔬 What I do
- 🌍 Analyze species distribution and temporal change using spatial statistics and machine learning
- 🌱 Develop and test eco-evolutionary simulation models in R
- 🧬 Investigate phylogenetic patterns and trait evolution
- 🛠️ Build reproducible research pipelines and contribute to developing R packages
- 📊 Visualize data with a strong focus on clarity and communication

### 💡 Current projects
- 🐾 Analysing [empirical](https://github.com/FriedaRosa/StaticPatterns_git) and [simulations](https://github.com/FriedaRosa/Simulate-Range-Change) of biodiversity change based on species traits, dispersal, and environment
- 🧪 Review and Development of unit tests for the [`RRatepol`](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/R-Ratepol-package) package
- 📦 Working on my [first package](https://friedarosa.shinyapps.io/Spatio-temporal-range-change/) for spatial pattern analysis based on different input and output parameters using fully adjustable individual-based simulations of spatial change.

### 💻 Tech stack
- **Languages:** R, Quarto/Markdown, a little Python, a little bash
- **Tools:** `tidymodels`, `ggplot2`, `terra`, `sf`, `ape`, `phytools`, Git/GitHub
- **Practices:** version control, unit testing, reproducibility, open science, AI models

### 🤝 Let's connect
I'm always open to meaningful collaborations in macroecology, simulation modeling, and spatial data science.

**Something to think about:**
> 🧠 “The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is [shown] by man attaining to a higher eminence... Thus man has ultimately become superior to woman.”

**Lessons learned**:

Proof that even the smartest people are fully capable of saying complete and utter bullshit.  
Thanks for evolution, Chuck — but we'll go ahead and evolve past that part.
